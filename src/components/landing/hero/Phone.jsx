                            <p>The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35) <br/><br/>

                                Jesus tells a story about a king who forgives a servantâ€™s enormous debt. However, that
                                same servant refuses to forgive a much smaller debt owed to him by another person. When
                                the king hears of this, he is angry and punishes the unforgiving servant.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The lesson: Just as God forgives us, we should also forgive others, even when they hurt
                                us. Holding onto bitterness harms us, but showing mercy brings peace.
